# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge
Write a function that takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
Use a recursive function with an accumulator variable; traverse through child nodes checking values against accumulator; return largest value to outer function.
