# Reverse an Array
A function that reverses an array

## Challenge
Write a function that takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach and Efficiency
I used a for loop with a range that iterates the provided array in reverse order. Each array item is then added to an output array.
